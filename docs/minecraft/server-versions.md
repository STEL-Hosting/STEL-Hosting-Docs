## Default Version
By default, all Minecraft servers are installed as Vanilla servers.

A Vanilla server is the standard multiplayer server software by Mojang. Vanilla servers allow you to experience the classic version of Minecraft with your friends, without any modifications or other features. At STEL Hosting, you are welcome to change your Minecraft server software from Vanilla. Our game panel offers one-click installations for the most popular Minecraft server software such as Spigot, Paper, Purpur, Forge, BungeeCord, Waterfall, and Fabric.

## How to Change Your Server Software
To change your server software, log in to the [control panel](https://panel.stelhosting.com/)

Next, click the `Configuration` tab and then click on `Advanced`

On this page, you will see an area that says `Install Different Edition`

From there, choose your desired server software from the dropdown menu, and then choose the Minecraft version you would like to play on

### Formatting
Important note about the "Format" button: Generally, if you are switching from Vanilla to Paper/Spigot, you do not need to click this button. The "Format" button deletes existing server files to install your new server software as a completely new server (this will delete your world).
