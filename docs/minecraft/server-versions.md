## Default Version
All Minecraft servers are installed as the version chosen when ordering your server.

A Vanilla server is the standard multiplayer server software by Mojang. Vanilla servers allow you to experience the classic version of Minecraft with your friends, without any modifications or other features. At STEL Hosting, you are welcome to change your Minecraft server software from Vanilla. Our game panel offers one-click installations for the most popular Minecraft server software such as Spigot, Paper, Purpur, Forge, BungeeCord, Waterfall, and Fabric.

## How to Change Your Server Software
To change your server software, log in to the [control panel](https://control.stelhosting.com/)

Once logged in, scroll down on the left-hand side navigation bar until you see the `Configuration` category. In this category, there will be a tab labeled `Versions`. Click on this tab to access the version changer.

On this page, you will see all the versions we offer on our one-click installer.

From there, choose your desired server software from the list, and then choose the Minecraft version you would like to play on. You may also choose the build number of the server software if applicable and optionally choose to wipe your server files before installing your new server software.

:::warning
**Be careful!** Wiping your server is permanent and irreversible. If you choose to wipe it, do a backup before proceeding, if it contains any data.
