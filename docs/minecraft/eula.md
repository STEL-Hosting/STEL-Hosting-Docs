## Introduction to Minecraft's EULA

All servers, no matter how or where they are hosted, must be in agreement with [Minecraft's EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).

The EULA is an agreement by you and Mojang AB / Microsoft Corporation regarding your use of Minecraft products and services.

A server will not start up until you have agreed to Minecraft's EULA.

## Agreeing to EULA

For your server to start up the first time, you must agree to the EULA. There are two ways this can be done:

Option 1:
1) Head over to our [control panel](https://control.stelhosting.com/) and go to the `Console` page.
2) Start your server and wait for a popup to appear for your agreement to Minecraft's EULA
3) Click on `Agree` when the popup appears

Option 2:
1) Head over to our [control panel](https://control.stelhosting.com/) and go to the `Files` page.
2) Find the file labeled `eula.txt` and click on it
3) Change `eula=false` to `eula=true`. Then, save the file

After doing either of these options, your server may start up for the first time. If you are still having trouble with your server starting up, please contact our support team.
