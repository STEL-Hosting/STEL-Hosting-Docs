## Introduction to the Whitelist

The whitelist can be used to restrict access to a Minecraft server. For example, you might be running a small survival multiplayer (SMP) server and want to limit access to people you know.

Only the players named on the whitelist can successfully connect to the server. Players not on the whitelist will be disconnected before they load the world. The only exception is server operators: players with operator permissions will successfully connect, even if they are not on the whitelist.
