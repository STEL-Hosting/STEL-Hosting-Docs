# Installing Modpacks with 1-click Installer
At STEL Hosting, our control panel offers 1-click installations of various modpacks. 

To install them, first, log in to our [control panel](https://panel.stelhosting.com/)

Once logged in, click on the `Tools` menu and then on the `Modpack Manager` tab

You will now be able to see a full list of modpacks offered on our control panel. If you don't see your modpack in the list, you can use the search bar to help you with your search.

To install a modpack, simply click on the `Install` button next to your desired modpack. Some modpacks will take a few minutes to install due to their large size.

Once installed, you are ready to start your server and start your adventure!
