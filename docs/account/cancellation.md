## Canceling Your Service
To submit a cancellation request, please log in to your account on our [website](https://stelhosting.com/index.php/login). You should now be able to access the [client area](https://stelhosting.com/clientarea.php).

Once logged in, click on `Services` on the top navigation bar and then click on `My Services`

Then, click on your service under the `Product/Service` section.

You will now see a red button that says `Request Cancellation`.


You will be prompted to choose a cancellation for `End of Billing Period` or `Immediate`.

`Immediate` cancellations will terminate your service with us and your server within 24 hours.

`End of Billing Period` will terminate your service with us and your server at 6:00 AM CST at the end of your billing period.


After submitting the cancellation request, you will not be billed further and your access to the server will be removed once the cancellation is processed.

### PayPal Subscriptions
It is your responsibility to ensure that PayPal subscriptions are properly canceled on your PayPal account after submitting a cancellation request. PayPal will continue to charge you if your PayPal subscription is still active in your profile.

Please visit their [article](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-is-an-automatic-payment-and-how-do-i-update-or-cancel-one-help240) on how to manage automatic payments.


Canceling a PayPal subscription does not cancel your service subscription with us - it only tells PayPal to stop charging your account! Please be sure to submit the cancellation request on our website should you no longer wish to continue using our services.

### Questions
For any questions related to billing, payments, or cancellations, please submit a support ticket on our website or email our billing department at `billing@stelhosting.com`
